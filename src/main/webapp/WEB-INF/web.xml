		There are three means to configure Wickets configuration mode and they

		1) A system property: -Dwicket.configuration 
		2) servlet specific <init-param> 
		3) context specific <context-param>

		The value might be either "development" (reloading when templates change) or 
		"deployment". If no configuration is found, "development" is the default. -->
